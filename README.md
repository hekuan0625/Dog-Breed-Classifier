## PyTorch CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, I built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

I created a CNN from scratch to classify dog breeds. I also used transfer learning to create a CNN for comparison between two models.


## Dataset Download

Make sure that you've downloaded the required human and dog datasets:
* Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location `data/dog_images`. 

* Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `data/human_images`.  


## Implementations 

### Run Example

`$ cd Dog-Breed-Classifier` <br/>
`$ python3 main.py`
